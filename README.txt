Computer graphics with virtual environments.

This course contains these fields:
* Computer graphics systems and models
* Computer graphic programming
* Input and interaction
* Geometric transformations
* Projection and rendering of 3D images
* Object modelling, hierarchical data structures and scenegraphs

-- User manual --
-----------------
You will start outside the car. You can fly all over the world. You can directly pic an object,
either to press tab (to switch to car view) or click with the mouse to set a box on fire.

--When you are outside the car:
-TAB: To drive the car.
   -w: forward
   -A: turn left
   -S: Backwards
   -D: turn right
-Left click with the mouse on a box to set the box on fire.
-Left click with mouse on the ball in the world to get the power to delete a box.
   -Press the key R before clicking on a box to delete it.

--When you are in the car:
-The world should support egocentric locomotion. But only when driving the car.
-Drive around with the keys:
   -w: forward
   -A: turn left
   -S: Backwards
   -D: turn right
   -Enter: To reset the car to start position.
   -Q: To place a new box at current location.
   -E: To place out snowballs at the cars startposition.
       -The snowballs has the picture. I did not take it by my selt but i google it and saved it.
        So I did not use any picture from the referenced libraries.

The class PhysicsTestHelper is from jmonkeyengine.org.
